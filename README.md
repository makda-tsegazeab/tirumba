Tirumba üöÄ
    
Tirumba (·å•·à©·àù·â£, Tigrinya and Amharic for "trumpet") is a Django-based RESTful API that modernizes funeral announcements in Tigray, Ethiopia. Drawing inspiration from the traditional practice of announcing funerals via bicycle and microphone, Tirumba delivers timely, reliable notifications through SMS, robocalls, and Telegram. Designed with scalability, reliability, and cultural sensitivity, it uses Tigrinya as the default language and targets specific kebeles (local areas) to ensure communities stay connected during times of loss.
‚ú® Features

Create Announcements: Admins submit funeral details (name, venue, date, audio) via a secure API.
Approval Workflow: Two-step verification ensures only trusted announcements are dispatched.
Multi-Channel Delivery: Supports SMS, robocalls, and Telegram for maximum reach.
Recipient Management: Stores phone numbers by kebele for targeted notifications.
Scalable Storage: Uses MinIO for reliable audio and photo uploads.
Asynchronous Processing: Celery and Redis handle background tasks like message dispatching.

üí° Motivation
In Tigray, funeral announcements are a cornerstone of community life, traditionally shared through loudspeakers or word-of-mouth. These methods can be slow and limited in reach. Tirumba digitalizes this process, making it efficient, inclusive, and respectful of cultural practices. As an Ethiopian developer with experience at YBS Software Development, I built Tirumba to leverage technology for community empowerment, ensuring timely and respectful communication.
